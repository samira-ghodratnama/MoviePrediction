In a world where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter?

The goal of this project is to work with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue.
